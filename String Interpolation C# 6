## C# 6 String Interpolation

Hi! Today I want to talk a little bit about **string interpolation** in C# 6.

### Old Way:

Let's say we wanted to create a string, inserting some values into it using trusty old string.Format().

```
string theWho = "Cookie Monster";
string theWhat = "cookies";

string theStory = string.Format("{0} loves {1}.", theWho, theWhat);
```

Now, this seems very comfortable for all of us who have been using this syntax for years.  But the Microsoft wizards have given us a new spell!

### New Way:

So the new way is a lot cleaner IMO.

```
string theWho = "Cookie Monster";
string theWhat = "cookies";

string theStory = $"{theWho} loves {theWhat}!";
```

Microsoft is not deprecating string.Format() so you're in luck if you prefer the 'old' syntax.  I know that I much prefer the new syntax!

Also, these behave just as you'd expect them to in relation to objects.
If, for example, we had the following object:
```
var cookieMonster = new CookieMonster
{
    Location = Locations.Kitchen,
    FavoriteCookie = CookieTypes.ChocolateChip
};

var theStory = $"All the {cookieMonster.FavoriteCookie} were stolen from the {cookieMonster.Location}!!"
```

This is one of my favorite new features of the language.  Stay tuned for more!
